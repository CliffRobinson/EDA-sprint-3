1. What is your site's primary purpose?

    This feels like a strange question to be asked by EDA, since EDA is the one that told me to make the website. Which means that the purpose is to practice making websites, which means the purpose of this individual website doesn't matter, which means it can be whatever I want it to be. So I'm going to use it show my work, both in EDA and personal projects. 

2. Who is your target audience?
    People who want to see my work. Conceivably this might mean professional contacts, but I think that's what GitHub is for. So it will probably end up being used by family and friends who want to see my projects. 

3. How do you want site visitors to interact with your website? What experience would you like them to have?
    Right now, this question is a little academic, because I don't have any projects that are ready for demonstration. I have some working Java programmes that do some neat things, but until I relearn how to make them into downloadable applets or host directly on the site, or my EDA work is ready for public demonstration, the only real experience my visitors can have is to say that it looks nice, and hopefully build anticipation for the projects I will be hosting. 

4. How will you build your website to support your desired user experience?
    Right now, the goal is to build a expandable structure that can host my various pieces of work. So even though I don't have much in the way of projects, I can make a template for demonstrating them that will make it easy to host future work.
